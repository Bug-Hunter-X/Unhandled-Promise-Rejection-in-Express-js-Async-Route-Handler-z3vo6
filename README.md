This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within route handlers are not properly handled, leading to unhandled promise rejections. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem
The issue lies in the insufficient error handling within the asynchronous operation in the route handler.  The `catch` block logs the error to the console, but it doesn't send an appropriate error response to the client or prevent the application from crashing due to the unhandled rejection.  This leads to a silent failure, making debugging difficult.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. It uses a `try...catch` block within an `async` function to handle potential errors synchronously.  If an error occurs, it sends a proper error response to the client with an appropriate status code (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error), providing more informative feedback and preventing application crashes.
